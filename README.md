```c
// Hello World in C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, Akshat!\n");
    return 0;
}
````

## 🧠 Tips for You:

1. `notes/` mein har topic ke `.md` file bana: `01_intro.md`, `02_loops.md`, etc.
2. Har code ko `code-examples/` folder mein save kar: `factorial.c`, `calculator.c`
3. Ek `projects/` folder mein 2–3 mini projects daal:  
   - Library Management System  
   - Bank Record System  
   - Quiz Game in C
